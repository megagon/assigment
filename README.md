Tried to complete as much as I can - ended on success/fail filter - it works, but API returned no data, didn't have time to figure out why.
for start - common npm i && npm start

I used react globe - for the globe, seems nice, expect can't render React componets

I used RTK - something that I know well

Something that I didn't have time to do at all - tests. Good tests require a lot of time and thinking, I decided to not spend time
on making tests just to have tests, but from structure point of view everything is ready to make them.

Another topic - structure. Some things I'd refactor after I finish, but that's something that can't be done good in short period of time.


Thank you for nice and unusual assigmen–µ
